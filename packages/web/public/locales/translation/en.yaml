        Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that allows you to select
        high-performance foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such
        as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon through
        a single API. It also provides a wide range of capabilities needed for
        building generative AI applications, enabling simplified development
        while maintaining privacy and security. By using Amazon Bedrock's
        comprehensive features, you can easily experiment with various top FMs,
        privately customize data using techniques like fine-tuning and
        retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and create managed agents that
        perform complex business tasks ranging from travel booking and insurance
        claim processing to advertising campaign creation and inventory
        management. All of this can be done without writing any code. Since
        Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don't need to manage infrastructure.
        Additionally, you can safely integrate and deploy generative AI
        capabilities into your applications using familiar AWS services.

        suited for your use case. Amazon Bedrock's serverless experience enables
        you to get started quickly with FMs, easily experiment with FMs,
        privately customize FMs with your own data, and seamlessly integrate and
        deploy FMs into your applications using AWS tools and capabilities.
        Amazon Bedrock Agents is a fully managed capability that makes it easy
        for developers to create generative AI applications that can provide
        up-to-date answers based on their own knowledge sources and complete
        tasks across a wide range of use cases. Bedrock's serverless experience
        enables you to get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your
        own data, and easily integrate and deploy them into your applications
        using familiar AWS tools and capabilities (including integration with
        Amazon SageMaker ML capabilities such as experiments for testing
        different models and pipelines for managing FMs at scale).

      {{form}} is a placeholder for defining an input form. It is written as
      {{form}} or {{form:label}}. {{form}} creates a form that accepts text

      use cases where you want to query a data source such as RAG but do not
      want to embed the query itself into the prompt.

      {{inputType}}. In this case, placeholders without a label are considered
      to be the same input. The actual executed prompt can be confirmed from the
